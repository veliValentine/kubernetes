# Kubernetes platform comparison
Comparison which is better kubernetes provide. [Openshift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) or [Rancher](https://rancher.com/)

I think Rancher is better than openshift.
Rancher is
-  100% open source
-  100% free
-  zero vendor lock-in
-  single interface for different cloud providers


Althought Openshift provides
- build in secure templates
- different cloud providers
- stronger offering

I would still choose Rancher.
